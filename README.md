# SNAKE-GAME
Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic implementation of the Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. Take a trip down memory lane and enjoy hours of entertainment as you control the snake and try to eat as much food as possible, all while avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself.

# Prerequisites
 Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for code editing

# How to Play
1. Getting Started: Open the index.html file in a modern web browser to start the game.

2. Controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) on your keyboard to control the snake's direction. The snake will continue moving in the chosen direction until you change it.

3. Objective: Your objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer.

40.Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls of the game area or if it collides with itself. Try to achieve the highest possible score by eating as much food as you can without crashing!

# Game Mechanics

This Snake Game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main components of the game include:

- index.html: This file contains the structure of the game, including the game board and necessary elements.

- style.css: This file contains the styling for the game, including the appearance of the snake, food, and game board.

- script.js: This file contains the game logic written in JavaScript. It handles the movement of the snake, generating food, detecting collisions, and updating the game state.

# Customization
Feel free to customize the game according to your preferences:

Adjust the speed of the snake by modifying the snakeSpeed variable in the script.js file.

Change the size of the game board, snake segments, or food by adjusting CSS properties in the style.css file.

Experiment with different colors and visual elements to give the game a unique look.

# Acknowledgments
This Snake Game project was created as a learning exercise and is inspired by the classic Snake game found on many early mobile phones and computers. It serves as a demonstration of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts in game development.

Special thanks to the online coding communities, tutorials, and resources that contributed to the development of this project.
