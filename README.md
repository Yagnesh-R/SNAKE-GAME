# Prerequisites
 Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for code editing

# How to Play
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
The snake will move continuously in the direction it's facing.
Your objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer.
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

# Game Mechanics

This Snake Game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main components of the game include:

- index.html: This file contains the structure of the game, including the game board and necessary elements.

- style.css: This file contains the styling for the game, including the appearance of the snake, food, and game board.

- script.js: This file contains the game logic written in JavaScript. It handles the movement of the snake, generating food, detecting collisions, and updating the game state.

# Customization
Feel free to customize the game according to your preferences:

Adjust the speed of the snake by modifying the snakeSpeed variable in the script.js file.

Change the size of the game board, snake segments, or food by adjusting CSS properties in the style.css file.

Experiment with different colors and visual elements to give the game a unique look.
